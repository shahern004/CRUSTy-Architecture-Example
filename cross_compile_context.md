# Cross-Compilation Setup Context

**Task:** Configure Rust project for `thumbv7em-none-eabi` cross-compilation.

**Status:** **COMPLETED**

- `rustup target list --installed` confirmed `thumbv7em-none-eabi` is NOT installed initially.
- Documentation was reorganized into `docs/` folder by the user (`README.md` remains at root).
- `thumbv7em-none-eabi` target installed.
- `.cargo/config.toml` created/updated.
- Initial build attempted (failed as expected, requires further steps).

**Completed Steps:**

1.  Installed `thumbv7em-none-eabi` target using `rustup target add thumbv7em-none-eabi`.
2.  Created/Updated `.cargo/config.toml` with:

    ```toml
    [build]
    target = "thumbv7em-none-eabi"

    [target.thumbv7em-none-eabi]
    linker = "arm-none-eabi-gcc"
    rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=-Tlink.x"]
    ```

3.  Attempted initial build using `cargo build --target thumbv7em-none-eabi` (failed as expected).

**Next Steps:** Resolve build errors for the `thumbv7em-none-eabi` target.
